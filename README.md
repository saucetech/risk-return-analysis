# risk-return-analysis

This project is a risk-return analysis of 4 major fund portfolios (Berkshire Hathaway, Tiger Global Management, Soros Fund Management, and PAulson & Co) in comparison to the S&P 500 Index. The goal of the quantitative analysis is to determine which fund offers the best investment potential based on key risk-management metrics of daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Summary

According to the risk return analysis, Berkshire Hathaway Inc was found to be the best investment potential across the four funds due to its leading Sharpe ratio as well as cumulative daily returns. Tiger Global Management was the next best fund with the second best Sharpe ratio, and a lower beta than Berkshire Hathaway. Soros Fund Management and Paulson & Co both possessed negative Sharpe ratios. Out of the four funds, none outperformed the S&P500.
